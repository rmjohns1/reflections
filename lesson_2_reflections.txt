What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Initializing a repository creates a .git subdirectory and prepares for the first commit

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is where you place only those files in a working directory that will be tracked using git.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	
	Because the staging area only includes the files that you want to commit changes on
	it forces you to be logical?
