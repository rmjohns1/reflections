What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Initializing a repository creates a .git subdirectory and prepares for the first commit

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is where you place only those files in a working directory that will be tracked using git.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	
	Because the staging area only includes the files that you want to commit changes on
	it forces you to be logical?

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

	Branches would be helpful when large experimental changes are being contemplated, but you still want to maintain
	the existing working version as the master branch.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	The diagrams help you see the relationship between parent and child commits going back in time.  Branches
	can be easily interpreted in this kind of diagram.
